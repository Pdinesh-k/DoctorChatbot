            "1. **Diagnosis**: If you suspect you have malaria, get tested using rapid diagnostic tests (dipsticks) or microscopy. If these tests are not available, diagnosis can be made based on clinical symptoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Medicine Treatment**: Take antimalarial drugs as prescribed by a healthcare professional. For non-severe malaria, oral treatment is usually given. However, if you vomit within the first hour of taking the medication, repeat the treatment.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **General Measures**: Provide supportive and symptomatic relief, monitor for complications, and ensure adequate hydration.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Rest and Recovery**: Rest and recover in a comfortable environment, avoiding excessive physical activity.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Prevention**: To prevent malaria, take antimalarial drugs before, during, and after traveling to areas where malaria is common. Use mosquito control measures such as insecticide-treated bed nets, and wear protective clothing.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Seek Medical Attention**: If you experience severe symptoms such as impaired consciousness, renal dysfunction, convulsions, or severe anaemia, seek medical attention immediately.\n",
            "\n",
